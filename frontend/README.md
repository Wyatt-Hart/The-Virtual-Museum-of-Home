# The Virtual Museum of Home

Inspiration for the application:
    The Virtual Museum of Home is an educational MERN application loosely inspired by Wikipedia. It uses a thumbnail grid of profile images representing Virtual Museum Exhibits.

How to use the application:
    The application is meant to be used in the classroom setting. The application uses user authentication to keep the app closed to the public, and protect student privacy. The administrator/teacher will invite students/users to join the app via email. Students can then create their own usernames and passwords.
    
    Users can make their own Virtual Museum Exhibit by opening the "Create an Exhibit" tab and entering their exhibit data--including image and video URLs.

Technologies used to build the application:
    Languages: HTML, CSS, JS
    Database: MongoDB
    Frameworks: Express, React, Node.js
    Platform: Heroku

Unfinished functionality:
    Exhibit creators will have the ability to edit their own exhibits. Presently, the application uses user authentication to establish if a user is the creator of an exhibit. If so, an edit button appears on their exhibit screen, but the edit button is not working yet.
